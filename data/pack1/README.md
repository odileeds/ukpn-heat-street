* 1A Total heat demand - Total heat demand (kWh_th) - Heat demand in kWh_th of all buildings, including new build 
* 2A Energy efficiency - Existing buildings total heat demand (kWh_th) - Heat demand in kWh_th of all buildings existing in 2020 in each LSOA. New builds and other changes to non-domestic footprint over time are excluded here to isolate the effect the energy efficiency
* 3A Elec for heat - Electricity demand for heat (kWh) - Electricity demand for space and hot water heating by LSOA, including new builds and district heating
* 4A LCH - Heating demand met (kWh_th) by each technology type - Heating demand in kWh_th met by each technology group in each LSOA
* 5 Dom tech and EE uptake - Uptake of domestic low carbon  heating technologies and energy efifiency measures (units) - Uptake of domestic low carbon heating technologies by year, and energy efifiency measures, in individual units. The avergae kWh per year saving of each energy effieicny measure is also given for reference.
* 6 Non-dom tech and EE uptake - Uptake of non-domestic low carbon  heating technologies and energy efifiency measures - Uptake of non-domestic low carbon heating technologies by year, and energy efifiency measures, in units of heating demand met and heating demand saved, respectively.
* 7 Emissions trajectories - Total CO2 emissions from heat trajectories (Mt CO2) - Total CO2 emissions for space heating and hot water, aggregated across the license areas
* 8 Aggregated fuel use - Aggregated fuel use (TWh) - Total fuel use in primary energy units (electricity, oil etc.) aggregated across the UKPN license areas
* 9 District heating technology - Assumptions for the transition to low carbon heating by scenario - Contains assumed dates for the transition to low carbon district heating by scenario, the type of low cabron heating by scenario, and the associated fuel intensity of heat for those technologies
