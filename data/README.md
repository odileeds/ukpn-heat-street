## Energy data

The UK Power Networks [Heat Street data](https://innovation.ukpowernetworks.co.uk/projects/heat-street-local-system-planning/) comes in four packs:

* [Data Pack 1: Heat and Energy Efficiency Uptake Scenarios](https://innovation.ukpowernetworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Heat-Street-data-pack_1_issued.xlsx) - Modelled decarbonisation of heat scenario outputs of the Heat Street project.
* [Data Pack 2: Building Stock](https://innovation.ukpowernetworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Heat-Street-data-pack_2_issued.xlsx) - Data on the domestic and non-domestic stock models used within the Heat Street project’s decarbonisation scenario modelling.
* [Data Pack 3: Consumer and Fuel Poverty impact](https://innovation.ukpowernetworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Heat-Street-data-pack_3_issued.xlsx) - Heat Street project modelling outputs; proportion of households by annual heating bill in each LSOA.
* [Data Pack 4: Additional Analysis on emissions, low carbon heating uptake and consumer impact](https://innovation.ukpowernetworks.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Heat-Street-data-pack_4_issued.xlsx) - This data pack contains the greenhouse gas emissions due to heating and the absolute numbers of low carbon heating uptake in 2030 and 2050 based on the forecasts in Data Pack 2. There is also some additional analysis of consumer impact. This additional analysis was carried out as a result of stakeholder feedback on the first three data packs.

## Geographic data

The [Local Authority Districts](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/local-authority-districts-april-2019-boundaries-uk-buc) are taken from [the ONS geo service](https://ons-inspire.esriuk.com/arcgis/rest/services/Administrative_Boundaries/Local_Authority_Districts_April_2019_Boundaries_UK_BUC/MapServer/0/query?where=1%3D1&text=&objectIds=&time=&geometry=&geometryType=esriGeometryEnvelope&inSR=&spatialRel=esriSpatialRelIntersects&relationParam=&outFields=*&returnGeometry=true&returnTrueCurves=false&maxAllowableOffset=&geometryPrecision=5&outSR=&having=&returnIdsOnly=false&returnCountOnly=false&orderByFields=&groupByFieldsForStatistics=&outStatistics=&returnZ=false&returnM=false&gdbVersion=&historicMoment=&returnDistinctValues=false&resultOffset=&resultRecordCount=&queryByDistance=&returnExtentOnly=false&datumTransformation=&parameterValues=&rangeValues=&quantizationParameters=&featureEncoding=esriDefault&f=geojson). They are [released under OGL](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/licences):
