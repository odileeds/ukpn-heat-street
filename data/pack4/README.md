* CO2 emissions	- Emissions by LSOA under each scenario, disaggregated by segment of the building stock. GHG emissions from domestic and nondomestic space heat and hot water in the UKPN license areas are given, measured in kilotonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (kg CO2)
* LCH uptake - Uptake of low carbon heating technology, and connections to district heating. The uptake of each technology is given in units deployed. District heating is also given, measured in number of homes connected. The technologies are grouped; "Heat pumps" includes both air-source and ground-source heat pumps. "Hybrid heat pumps" include heat pumps operating in conjunction with a secondary heating technology. This category is made up of mostly heat pumps with bioenergy, deployed in off-gas grid properties, but also includes a small fraction of heat pumps with hydrogen boilers (except in the Consumer Transformation scenario), and heat pumps with electric resistive heating. 
* All stock mean fuel bills - Mean fuel bills. "Mean fuel bill across full stock in UKPN license areas, in 2030 and 2050, and after the ordered application of the following three steps:
  1. Fuel price projections are applied to give the fuel bill in 2030 and 2050, before any measure deployment
  2. Energy efficiency measures are applied, reducing the fuel bill in proportion to the heating demand saving
  3. The heating technology for each archetype is switched from the initial system to the final, low carbon, system"
* Fuel poor stock mean fuel bills - Mean fuel bills. "Mean fuel bill across the fuel poor stock in UKPN license areas, in 2030 and 2050, and after the ordered application of the following three steps:
  1. Fuel price projections are applied to give the fuel bill in 2030 and 2050, before any measure deployment
  2. Energy efficiency measures are applied, reducing the fuel bill in proportion to the heating demand saving
  3. The heating technology for each archetype is switched from the initial system to the final, low carbon, system"
